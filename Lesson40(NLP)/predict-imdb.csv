review
The movie was very bad. The players showed a poor performance. The script is not interesting.
I liked the movie very much. The players also played well. The ending of the movie was very surprising.
The movie is a work of medium quality. I think it's neither good nor bad.
Great movies should always leave you with a feeling during or after seeing them.
The worst movie I've ever seen in my life
I can't say that I am very happy that I went to this movie.
